<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
This paper examines how a traumatic experience across differential cultural configurations,
can shed light on norms of risk sharing and community cultural persistence, in the context
of Great Chinese Famine (1959-1961). We use cross mortality-clan-cohort variations and a
difference-in-difference-in-differences method to study the evolution of clan culture values in
the wake of the Famine. Our fnding documents that the famine exposed cohort that live
in a stronger clan county report higher level of trust in their clan members, relative to the
people who didn't perceive a sever famine. Our fnding are robust to a set of placebo tests
and robustness check. The results remain stable for dynamic effects models. This paper
contributes to literature on the effects on traumatic experience by focusing on a particular
aspect, i.e., the formation and evolution of personal belief.
