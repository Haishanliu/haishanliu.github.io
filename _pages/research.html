				The market for on-demand food delivery (ODFD) has increased considerably, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is
				crucial for transportation and environmental agencies to understand how ODFD has reshaped the travel patterns of people,
				affecting vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) as well as pollutant emissions in the transportation system. However, the lack of
				public data from food delivery companies makes it challenging to quantify the impact of on-demand delivery on the
				real-world transportation network. In this research, we propose a comprehensive framework to quantify the VMT and
				emissions incurred by ODFD with three main components: (i) a daily activity generation tool, Comprehensive Econometric
				Micro-simulator for Daily Activity-travel Patterns, to create a simulation scenario of ODFD behaviors based on a
				real-world roadway network and population demographics in the City of Riverside, California; (ii) an efficient order
				dispatching and routing algorithm, adaptive large neighborhood search, to obtain a high quality order dispatching and
				routing plan; (iii) an emission evaluation model, emission factor (EMFAC), to evaluate pollutant emissions from all
				dining-related trips. Both short-term and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are evaluated. Experimental results
				show that ODFD has great potential to reduce the dining-related VMT and emissions. The total dining-related VMT in the
				during-pandemic case decreased by 38% and in the after-pandemic case reduced by 6% to 9%, and the corresponding
				environmental impacts were reduced accordingly. Meanwhile, emissions reduced significantly with more electric vehicles
				involved in food delivery. With 100% electric delivery fleet, the ODFD service can save 14% to 22% of emissions after
				the COVID-19 pandemic.

			The prevalence of information and communication technologies has catalyzed the emergent on-demand meal delivery (ODMD)
			service. Order dispatching policies play a crucial role in determining the operational performance and environmental
			impact of ODMD system. In this paper, the authors proposed a comprehensive framework to evaluate meal delivery
			efficiency and quantify the corresponding environmental impact of ODMD system under different order dispatching
			policies. It consists of three components: (1) the real-world meal delivery operational context that is generated to
			simulate daily activities and travel patterns in the city of Riverside and construct the on-demand meal delivery
			scenarios; (2) an efficient optimization approach: rolling horizon-based adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm,
			to obtain order dispatching and routing decisions with the dynamic order demand and driver resources; and (3) an energy
			consumption and emission evaluation model developed via EMFAC to quantify the corresponding fuel consumption and
			pollutant emissions. With the proposed framework, three order dispatching policies are evaluated: One-Order-Per-Trip
			(One-O), One-Restaurant-Per-Trip (One-R), and Multi-Restaurant-Per-Trip (Multi-R). Simulation results show substantial
			benefits of having orders bundled in the One-R and Multi-R policies. The total travel distance is reduced by 14% and
			30%, respectively, compared to the One-O policy. Meanwhile, the total number of delivery drivers is reduced by 36% and
			60%, which shows great potential to relieve the urban traffic burdens, together with 14%–30% fuel consumption, GHG
			emissions, and criteria pollutant emissions reductions. Meanwhile, the service quality is maintained with only 1% of
			late orders.
